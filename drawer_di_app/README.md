# Drawer DI application

## Description

This project illustrates how to integrate DI into your app using BLoC-architecture.

This app has some demo screens and uses Drawer component (side menu). That part sometimes can be tricky to understand.

That is the third project in our Flutter articles series. To look at previous ones, go to https://github.com/Inostudio/flutter-articles/tree/master/simple_bloc_app and https://github.com/Inostudio/flutter-articles/tree/master/bloc_context_app.


## Prerequisites

You will need Flutter framework installed. Check out official site for the detailed instruction. No other configuration is required.
